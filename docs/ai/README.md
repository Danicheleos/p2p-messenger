# AI Development Log

This directory contains implementation logs for each development phase of the P2P Chat application. These logs serve as context for AI assistants and developers working on the project.

## Purpose
- Track implementation decisions and actions taken
- Provide context for future development phases
- Document technical decisions and rationale
- Maintain a record of what was built and why

## Phase Logs
- [Phase 1: Foundation](./phase-1-foundation.md) - ✅ Completed

## Usage
After completing each phase, create a new markdown file documenting:
- What was implemented
- Technical decisions made
- Files created/modified
- Build status
- Known limitations
- Next steps

This helps maintain continuity across development sessions and provides valuable context for AI assistants.
